# MediPath

Medipath is a C++ mapping software for ambulance drivers to efficiently locate the shortest routes to hospitals and pharmacies, leveraging OpenStreetMap API, GTK, and EZGL libraries.
Implemented the A* and Multi Dijkstra algorithms to optimize pathfinding by using multi-threading, incorporating real-time traffic data using the TomTom API for improved accuracy and response times.
